# Kanji Test

Kanji Test is an interactive application designed to help users learn and memorize Japanese kanji characters. The app provides a simple, yet effective way to practice kanji readings (kana) by displaying random kanji and prompting the user to input the correct kana. It's perfect for beginners and those looking to reinforce their knowledge of kanji.

## Features

- **Random Kanji Display**: The app shows random kanji characters from a list, making it easy to practice new ones regularly.
- **Kana Input**: Test your knowledge by typing the correct kana for each displayed kanji.
- **Real-time Feedback**: The app will inform you whether your answer is correct or incorrect and help you learn the correct kana if necessary.
- **Automatic Revision**: If you close the application, it will automatically reopen after 10 minutes for effective revision. This ensures that you can continue practicing without forgetting what you've learned.
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: The app has a clean, user-friendly interface to focus solely on learning kanji.

## Usage

Once you open the app, you will see a kanji character displayed on the screen. You can type its kana (hiragana or katakana) in the input box and press Enter to move to the next kanji.

If you get the correct answer, the app will load a new kanji for you to practice. If your answer is incorrect, it will show you the correct kana.
